# Description_and_Notes
#	Description:  Increment cores from a total of 297 living and dead European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) trees were newly collected at three sites (1, 2, 3) within the same ecological context as the original site 4 (Serre 1978). 
#       A unique network >3000 TRW series from 61 locations distributed over the Austrian, Swiss, Slovenian, Italian, and French Alps (see B�ntgen et al. 2008a for details) was utilized
#       for an Alpine-wide comparison of larch growth responses to variations in summer temperature. The geographical mean of this exceptional Alpine-wide collection is centered
#       over the Italian Dolomites (46.63 �N, 11.86 �E and 1,667 m asl).

#       Abstract: A millennium-long tree-ring width chronology of living and dead larch (Larix decidua Mill.) specimens from the Maritime French Alps was introduced 35 years ago. This
#       record has been included in various large-scale temperature reconstructions, though recent analyses revealed only weak associations with regional summer temperatures. Calibration
#       and verification trials against instrumental measurements were, however, limited by the original record�s early ending in 1974. Here we introduce an update of this widely considered
#       chronology until 2007 and back into medieval times. A total of 297 new larch samples from high-elevation settings in the southern French Alps were included, and the combined
#       398 measurement series allowed effects of tree-ring detrending and chronology development to be explored. Comparisons with meteorological temperature, precipitation and drought
#       indices revealed weak and temporally inconsistent climate sensitivity. To further place these local findings in a biogeographic context, we used >3,000 larch trees from 61 locations
#       across the Alpine arc. This unique network approach confirmed fading temperature sensitivity with decreasing latitude, and thus questioned the overall reliability of ring width-based
#       temperature reconstructions in the Mediterranean region. Our results further emphasize the pending need to develop chronologies from maximum latewood densities and stable isotope
#       ratios across the lower latitudes, and to carefully evaluate ecological site conditions and methodological data restrictions prior to compiling local data into global networks.
